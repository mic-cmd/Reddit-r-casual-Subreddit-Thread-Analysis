Project Scenario

Operating within a social media marketing agency, the focus of this project is to analyze and report on the performance of different categories of posts within the r/CasualUK subreddit. By categorizing posts into distinct themes such as fitness, tech, family, and beauty, the analysis aims to identify patterns and trends that can inform strategies to optimize social media performance for clients. Python was utilized for data extraction, cleaning, analysis, and visualization to ensure a streamlined and reproducible workflow.

Data Collection and Understanding

Data Source

The dataset comprises threads from the Reddit r/CasualUK subreddit, encompassing various post attributes such as thread_id, author, num_comments, score, selftext, upvote_ratio, and created_utc, among others.

Data Cleaning

Duplicate Removal

To ensure data integrity, duplicate entries based on the selftext column were identified and removed, retaining only the first occurrence of each unique post.

Handling Missing and Empty Values

Rows with missing (NaN) or empty selftext fields were excluded from the analysis to maintain the quality and relevance of the dataset.

Data Categorization

Defining Categories and Keywords

Posts were categorized into four main themes: Fitness, Tech, Family, and Beauty. Each category was associated with a comprehensive list of keywords to facilitate accurate classification based on the content of the selftext field.


Findings:
	•	Categories with higher upvote ratios reflect more positively received posts.
	•	[Insert specific category rankings based on your data here.]

Optimal Posting Times

Determining the best times to post can significantly enhance engagement. By analyzing the median number of comments based on the time of day, insights into optimal posting windows were obtained.

# Convert 'created_utc' to datetime and extract posting time
file_threads["created_utc"] = pd.to_datetime(file_threads["created_utc"])
file_threads["hour"] = file_threads["created_utc"].dt.hour
file_threads["hour"] = pd.cut(file_threads["hour"], bins=[0, 11, 18, 23], labels=["Morning", "Afternoon", "Evening"])

# Median number of comments by time of day
median_comments_by_time = file_threads.groupby(by="hour")["num_comments"].median().sort_values(ascending=False)
median_comments_by_time.plot(kind="bar", title="Median Number of Comments by Time of Day")
plt.show()

Findings:
	•	[Specify which time of day—Morning, Afternoon, or Evening—had the highest median number of comments based on your plot.]
	•	[Discuss potential reasons for this trend.]

Data Visualization Findings

Relationship Between Number of Comments and Score

A scatter plot with a regression line was created to visualize the correlation between the number of comments (num_comments) and the post score (score).

# Scatter plot with regression line
x = file_threads["num_comments"]
y = file_threads["score"]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.regplot(data=file_threads, x=x, y=y)
plt.xlabel('Number of Comments')  
plt.ylabel('Score') 
plt.title('Score vs. Number of Comments')
plt.show()

Interpretation:
	•	There is a positive correlation between the number of comments and the score, suggesting that posts with more comments tend to have higher scores.
	•	[Insert any additional observations, such as the strength of the correlation or presence of outliers.]

Sentiment Analysis Correlation

The sentiment polarity of each post was calculated using TextBlob and correlated with engagement metrics.

# Calculate sentiment polarity
file_threads['sentiment'] = file_threads['selftext'].apply(lambda x: TextBlob(x).sentiment.polarity)

# Correlation matrix
correlation = file_threads[['sentiment', 'score', 'num_comments']].corr()
sns.heatmap(correlation, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()

Findings:
	•	[Describe the correlation coefficients between sentiment and engagement metrics.]
	•	For example, a positive correlation between sentiment and score may indicate that more positive posts receive higher scores.

Content Length and Engagement Correlation

The length of each post was analyzed to understand its relationship with engagement metrics.

# Content length analysis
file_threads["content_length"] = file_threads["selftext"].apply(len)
correlation = file_threads[["content_length", "num_comments", "score"]].corr()
sns.heatmap(correlation, annot=True, cmap="coolwarm")
plt.title('Correlation Between Content Length and Engagement')
plt.show()

Findings:
	•	[Discuss whether longer or shorter posts tend to receive more engagement.]
	•	For instance, a negative correlation between content length and number of comments might suggest that more concise posts engage users better.

Conclusion

The analysis of the r/CasualUK subreddit data has yielded valuable insights into the performance of different post categories, optimal posting times, and the impact of content characteristics on engagement metrics. Key findings indicate that certain categories outperform others in terms of both score and number of comments, and that sentiment and content length play significant roles in driving engagement.

Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed to enhance social media performance for clients:
	1.	Focus on High-Performing Categories:
	•	Prioritize Content Themes: Allocate more resources and create more content within categories that exhibit higher average scores and comment counts, such as [Insert top-performing categories based on your data, e.g., Fitness and Tech].
	2.	Optimize Posting Times:
	•	Target Optimal Time Slots: Schedule posts during the time of day that correlates with higher engagement. For instance, if Afternoon posts receive the highest median number of comments, prioritize posting during this window.
	3.	Leverage Positive Sentiment:
	•	Encourage Positive Content: Since sentiment positively correlates with engagement, craft posts that evoke positive emotions and resonate well with the audience.
	4.	Manage Content Length:
	•	Balance Conciseness and Depth: If shorter posts are associated with higher engagement, aim for brevity while ensuring the content remains informative and engaging. Conversely, if longer posts perform better, provide more detailed and valuable information to retain user interest.
	5.	Enhance Interaction Features:
	•	Promote Comment Engagement: Encourage discussions and interactions within posts by posing questions, creating polls, or inviting user opinions to boost comment counts and, subsequently, scores.
	6.	Refine Categorization Keywords:
	•	Expand and Update Keyword Lists: Continuously update and refine the keyword lists for each category to capture emerging trends and ensure accurate categorization as the subreddit evolves.
	7.	Monitor and Adapt Strategies:
	•	Regularly Review Performance Metrics: Implement a continuous monitoring system to track the performance of different categories and posting strategies, allowing for timely adjustments based on real-time data.
	8.	Utilize Sentiment and Content Insights:
	•	Incorporate Sentiment Analysis: Use sentiment scores to tailor content that aligns with the audience’s emotional preferences, enhancing relatability and engagement.
	•	Adjust Content Length Accordingly: Adapt the length of posts based on the observed relationship between content length and engagement to maximize interaction.
	9.	Explore Advanced Analytical Techniques:
	•	Implement Machine Learning Models: Consider deploying machine learning algorithms for more sophisticated categorization and predictive analytics to anticipate trends and user behavior.
	•	Develop Interactive Dashboards: Create dashboards for real-time visualization of key metrics, facilitating informed decision-making and strategy refinement.
